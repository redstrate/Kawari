# Kawari

A replacement server for a certain MMO. Updates on the project can be found [on my blog](https://redstrate.com/blog/series/kawari-progress-report/).

## Goals

Kawari is primarily a research project, but also a way to preserve the modern client. Kawari is...
* **FOR** preservation of the game, in the event that the servers are permanently unavailable.
* **FOR** exploring the packet structure for legitimate purposes (e.g. archival and preservation.)
* **NOT** a way to play the game without a valid subscription.
* **NOT** for creating bots, packet modifications or doing anything on the retail servers.

## Supported Game Version

Kawari currently supports patch **7.18h**. Kawari will never "roll back" to a previous patch. There are other servers (e.g. Sapphire) that support older versions of the game.

Only the Global region is supported. Only the Windows client is supported. Supporting other regions or clients are currently out of scope of this project.

## Running

A guide to running Kawari can be followed [here](USAGE.md).
