# Acceptable Usage

**The primary objective of Kawari is to extend the game's longevity, while enabling research of the game's internals - not to enable piracy**. But since we are a server emulator, we're already in a grey area of legality and copyright. We do not intend to infringe on copyrighted work in a harmful way. This document is meant to codify some ethics, meant to minimize our impact and set boundaries.

> [!NOTE]
> "Playable retail account" in this document means: Being in possession of an account that can log in to the retail server. This is either an active subscription or a free trial account.

You may **not** use Kawari (our code, resources and community) to:

* Circumvent the game's copy protection.
* Create and research automated bots, "DDOS" techniques or other attack vectors.
* Leak/spread new and planned to-be-released content.
* Publicly run[^1] and/or monetize a third-party server.

We can't prevent you from doing stupid things in private, but we publicly refuse to condone these actions.

Additionally, here are some explicit limitations for contributions in our community:

* All contributors **must** be in possession of a playable retail account to participate.
* All contributors **must not** accept donations on behalf of our project.
* Support for patches **must only** be posted _after_ they are publicly available in their respective region.
  * "Publicly available" means: Maintenance is over, and you're able to log in to a World with the new client.
* Support for limited-time festivals or events **must only** be made available[^2] after they are publicly available in their respective region.
  * "Publicly available" means: The festival actually begun in-game.
  * The game may overwrite or change older festivals with newer NPCs or objects. To be safe, this rule will still apply - even if said things appear in an older event it wasn't designed originally for.

[^1]: This means running a publicly available instance on the Internet, advertising it and so on. Playing with friends you know is totally OK, of course.
