# Data files

This folder contains data files (usually compiled into the Kawari binaries) that define various constants that change frequently. You probably don't want to actually edit these by hand (apart from adding new opcodes), instead please see [our documentation](https://docs.xiv.zone/kawari/contributing.html#updating-to-new-patches) on how to update these.
