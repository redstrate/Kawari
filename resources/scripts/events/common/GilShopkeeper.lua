        22 u32s are used to represent the ten buyback items. Most of these values are still unknown in meaning, but they likely relate to melds, crafting signature, durability, and more.
        Historically, it seems cutscene 00040 was used instead of 00010 as it is now.
        When the client concludes business with the shop, the scene finishes and returns control to the server. The server will then have the client play scene 255 with no params.
