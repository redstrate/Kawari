# Introduction to Scripting

Kawari is designed to be extensible out-of-the-box, allowing developers and tinkerers alike to add existing or new content to the server without recompiling the source code. We decided to do this via the [Lua scripting language](https://lua.org), the same one the retail game uses.

If you already know how to program in Lua, we use Lua 5.4. We won't give a baby-steps tutorial for Lua, there is plenty of better guides out there in the world to teach you.

There are currently guides for scripting:
* [Commands](commands.md)

If you don't see an item here that's listed, it may be because it's unimplemented or the API is still too unstable.

When you need to start delving into reverse engineering more of the game's Lua, there's [a guide on how to use Scripter to help you](scripter.md)!
