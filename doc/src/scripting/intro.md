# Introduction to Scripting

Kawari is designed to be extensible out-of-the-box, allowing developers and tinkerers alike to add existing or new content to the server without recompiling the source code. We decided to do this via the [Lua scripting language](https://lua.org), the same one the retail game uses.

If you already know how to program in Lua, we use Lua 5.4. We won't give a baby-steps tutorial for Lua, there is plenty of better guides out there in the world to teach you.

There are currently guides for scripting the following features:
* [Commands](commands.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see a feature listed here, it's either because it's unimplemented or its scripting API isn't stable yet.

When you need to start delving into reverse engineering more of the game's Lua, there's [a guide on how to use Scripter to help you](scripter.md)!
