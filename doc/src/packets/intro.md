# Reverse Engineering Packets

If you want to help reverse engineer the network layer of FFXIV, you'll first need to setup a packet capturing solution. You have a few choices, but our documentation focuses on two specific projects:

* [Project Chronofoil](https://github.com/ProjectChronofoil/), which should be preferred but requires Dalamud.
* [Temporal Stasis](https://github.com/NotNite/TemporalStasis), which requires more setup but can be used in cases where Dalamud cannot.

To begin, start by reading [our guide on setting up Chronofoil](chronofoil.md). We don't have a guide for setting up Temporal Stasis yet.
