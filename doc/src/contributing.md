# Contributing and working on Kawari

Here are various helpful resources and tips when working on Kawari.

## Recommended Dalamud plugins

Here are some Dalamud plugins that will make your life easier:

* [AllowLoginFail](https://codeberg.org/redstrate/AllowLoginFail) to stop the game from rage quitting after hitting lobby errors.
* [Scripter](https://codeberg.org/redstrate/Scripter) for inspecting the client's Lua state.

## Updating to new patches

Updating Kawari can be quite involved, and so we developed a tool to automate the process. You can find said tool [here](https://codeberg.org/redstrate/KawariUpdater).

## Contributing

Before making a pull request, make sure:

* Kawari compiles and runs fine. At a minimum, you should be able to login to the World server.
* Run `cargo fmt` to ensure your code is formatted.
* Run `cargo clippy` and fix all of the warnings for any new code, to the best of your ability.

## Testing local Physis

Sometimes, you need to be able to test changes without committing or
pushing changes to Physis. But since we depend on other crates that define
their dependency on Physis you need to do this a certain way.

Add this line to the bottom of your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[patch."https://github.com/redstrate/Physis"]
physis = { path = "/path/to/your/Physis" }
```

This will ensure all of the dependencies target your local Physis checkout and you don't end up with multiple conflicting library versions.

## Use of Generative AI

This project does not allow contributions generated by large languages models (LLMs) and chatbots. This ban includes, but is not limited to, tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, and Devin AI. We are taking these steps as precaution due to the potential negative influence of AI generated content on quality, as well as likely copyright violations.

This ban of AI generated content applies to all parts of the projects, including, but not limited to, code, documentation, issues, and artworks. An exception applies for purely translating texts for issues and comments to English.

AI tools can be used to answer questions and find information. However, we encourage contributors to avoid them in favor of using existing documentation and our chat. Since AI generated information is frequently misleading or false, we cannot supply support on anything referencing AI output.
