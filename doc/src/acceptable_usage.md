# Acceptable Usage

Kawari is a "server emulator", and thus sits in a largely grey area in terms of legality and copyright. While we do not intend to infringe on copyrighted work, courts rarely go in an individual's favor and we definitely aren't the exception. We also actively target the latest game version, thus could be (unfortunately) viewed as a competitor to the retail servers.

**The primary objective of Kawari is to extend the game's longevity, while enabling research of the game's internals**. To make our stances absolutely clear, we have some explicitly disallowed actions while using Kawari publicly or working on it as a community project.

In this document we mention "playable retail account" which means what it says: you are in possession of an account able to log in to the retail server. This is usually an active paid subscription, but can also include a free trial account.

You may **not** use Kawari, meaning our code, resources and community to:

* Play the game without a playable retail account. The server can't, nor is designed to be a 1-to-1 replacement of retail servers.
* Create automated bots, or performing network-related actions on retail servers.
* Leak/spread new and planned to-be-released content.
* Publicly run[^1] or monetize a Kawari server.

Any questions or implications of the above is not allowed in any part of our community. While we cannot prevent people from doing stupid things in private, we have to take measures to ensure we don't enable that.

Additionally, here are some explicit limitations for contributions in our community:

* All contributors must be in possession of a playable retail account to participate in the community.
  * "Participation" does include the implication of using Kawari. We won't force you to leave if you're taking a break from the game, of course. But if we see you say: "Wow Kawari is so cool, I'm using it right now!" but you cancelled your subscription, we have to ask you to stop.
* All contributors must not accept donations on behalf of the Kawari project.
* Support for patches must only be made available[^2] _after_ they are publicly available in their respective region.
  * This means the game allows you to login, enter a retail World and actually play.
* Support for limited-time festivals or events must only be made available[^2] _after_ they are publicly available in their respective region.
  * This means the festival has actually begun somewhere in the world, not when it was scheduled or added to the game.
  * Due to the nature of limited-time festivals, they may overwrite/change older festivals with newer NPCs or events. To be safe, this rule still applies - even if the new NPC appears in an older event it wasn't designed for.
  
If something is not explicitly disallowed but you are unsure of whether it may be, you may want to [contact me](https://redstrate.com/contact) privately.

[^1]: This doesn't mean you can't play with your friends, we mean running a publicly available instance on the Internet and advertising it.
[^2]: "Only be made available" means that: no Pull Request is created, and ideally nothing is not uploaded (even to a fork.) Better to err on the side of caution, if you can.
